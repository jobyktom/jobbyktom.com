													<p>While they accompany you online, they will share various creative and interesting spiritual themes with you. These themes are called scrolls, originally from the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
													<p>Based on these themes, discussions will be initiated between you and your Faith Friend. This will help deepen your faith.</p>
